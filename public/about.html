        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            At <strong>CommunityTreks</strong>, our mission is to connect outdoor enthusiasts—runners, hikers, and skiers—with high-quality, user-driven route information while fostering a sense of community. 
            We believe that the outdoors should be accessible and enjoyable for everyone, without barriers like subscription fees or intrusive advertisements. 
            By emphasizing community contributions and curated routes, we aim to inspire and empower adventurers to explore, share, and celebrate the trails together.

        <!-- About the Creator Section -->
        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m <strong>Samuel Beste</strong>, the creator of CommunityTreks. Over the past three years, I’ve discovered a deep love for the trails through trail running and backpacking. 
            My journey includes thru-hiking over 3,000 miles across iconic routes like the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), Colorado Trail (CT), and Tahoe Rim Trail (TRT), as well as running four ultramarathons, 
            two of which spanned 100 miles or more. Creating CommunityTreks is my way of giving back to the outdoor community that has given me so much joy and inspiration. 
            This platform is designed to help others discover new routes, share their experiences, and connect with a supportive community of adventurers.
        </p>
